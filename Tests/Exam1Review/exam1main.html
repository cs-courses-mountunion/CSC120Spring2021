        <br />
      </li>
      <li> Before you run the program, write down
    what you think will be the output in <b>both</b> the Java Console <b>and</b> in the
    MUPanel window. Pretend you are the computer, and trace the execution
    steps and method calls one line at a time. <br/><br/>

    After you've written down on paper what you think the output will be,
    check yourself by running the program.

  <li><b>Declare, instantiate, and use objects from an existing class.</b><br />

    <ol>
      <li>Create a new Netbeans project called Exam1c. Make sure the
Location is in your H:\CSC120\Java folder.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>Minimize NetBeans, but do not close the project or NetBeans.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li><b>Copy needed files into your src folder.</b><br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>In a web browser right click on each of<br />
            <b><a href="Exam1c/MUPanel.java">MUPanel.java</a></b>, and <br />

and choose <b>Save Target As...</b> and save the files in the src
folder of your project.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>Look over the Tester class.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>Then edit MUPanel.java so that it contains code that declares,
instantiates and draws three Tester objects.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>The objects should appear in a straight line evenly spaced
across the output window.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>Run the program and ensure that it works as described here.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>Then in the <b><code>paintComponent()</code></b> method
	      of <code>MUPanel</code>, before drawing
the three objects, use the <b><code>setTesterColor</code></b> method
to change the color of one of the objects to any color other than
Color.BLACK or Color.WHITE, and change the color of another one of the
objects to Color.WHITE (leave the color of the third object unchanged).<br />
        <br />
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <hr>
  <li><b>Write a complete class definition including private data,
constructor, getters, setters, toString, and draw.</b><br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>Create a new Netbeans project called Exam1d. Make sure the
Location is in your H:\CSC120\Java folder.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>Minimize NetBeans, but do not close the project or NetBeans.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li><b>Copy needed files into your src folder.</b><br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>In a web browser right click on <br />
            <b><a href="Exam1d/MUPanel.java">MUPanel.java</a></b>,<br />
and choose <b>Save Target As...</b> and save the files in the src
folder of your project.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>Look over the MUPanel.java file.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>Then write a complete class definition for a class called
ThingToBeDrawn, that is used by this program.&nbsp; Right-click on the
<b>src</b> folder of the Exam1d project and choose "New | Java Class" to create
a file named <b>ThingToBeDrawn.java</b> for this part of the lab.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>The private data (properties) for the ThingToBeDrawn class
should be an Integer called anchorX, an Integer called anchorY, a Color named theColor,
and a String called nameOfThing.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>You will need to add an import statement at the top of the
ThingToBeDrawn class, so that it will find the Color class and the
Graphics class. At the top of the ThingToBeDrawn.java file above the
class header line add this line:
        <pre>        import java.awt.*;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><p>The constructor for the ThingToBeDrawn class should have 4
parameters (2 Integer values, one Color and one String), and use the parameters 
to initialize the corresponding data
members.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Now write the getAnchorX (returns the value of the anchorX data
member) and setAnchorX (sets the anchorX data member to the value of the
method's one parameter) methods for the ThingToBeDrawn class.<br />
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Write a draw method in the ThingToBeDrawn class. This method
returns nothing (void), and expects a Graphics parameter called g.&nbsp; 
First of all, this method should call the <code>g.setColor</code> method to
change the drawing color to <code>theColor</code>.&nbsp; Next, fill a
rectangle that is located at the (anchorX, anchorY) point on the screen &ndash; make
the rectangle 80 pixels wide and 50 pixels high.&nbsp; Then it should use
<code>g.drawString</code> to draw nameOfThing below the rectangle on the
screen.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Run the program, fix any errors, etc to test it. After you
get this working, proceed to the next step.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>Edit your ThingToBeDrawn class adding a toString method.<br />
        <br />
        <b> The toString method for a class should return a String that
describes the object in terms of its data values. Your ThingToBeDrawn
class has data members anchorX, anchorY, theColor, and thingName, so your toString
method should return a String that uses all of those variables in a
sentence. If you aren't sure how to make the toString method, then look
at the toString method for Exam1b's SportsCar class as an example.<br />
        <br />
        </b> </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  </li>
  <hr>
  <li><b>Use methods of the <code>Graphics</code> class to draw specific shapes.</b><br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>Create a new Netbeans project called Exam1e. Make sure the
Location is in your H:\CSC120\Java folder.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>Minimize NetBeans, but do not close the project or NetBeans.<br />
        <br />
      </li>
      <li><b>Copy needed files into your src folder.</b><br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>In a web browser right click on <br />
            <b><a href="Exam1e/MUPanel.java">MUPanel.java</a></b>,<br />
and choose <b>Save Target As...</b> and save the file in the src
folder of your project.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>In the <code>paintComponent</code> method of the MUPanel class, write code that does the following:<br/><br/>
           <ol type="a">
		       <li> Fill a rectangle that is three times as wide as it is high, in whatever color you wish.<br/><br/></li>
			   <li> Next, change the drawing color, and then fill a square that is half as wide as the first
			        rectangle, and whose upper-left corner point is the lower-right corner point of the
					first rectangle.<br/><br/></li>
			   <li> Then change the drawing color to a third color that is different than the other two, and fill a 
			        circle that is half as high as the original rectangle, and touches the lower-left corner point
					of that rectangle at the middle-right point of the circle (the point on the circle that would
					be EAST on a compass, or 0 degrees if we think of a Java arc).<br/><br/></li>
			   <li>Your shapes should be touching as in this illustration:<br/><br/>
