<h2>Practicum 1 Description</h2>

<blockquote>A practicum is an in-lab, on-computer, timed test.&nbsp; The
        activities are designed to be completed in 45 minutes or less, thus allowing
        a significant amount of additional time for students during the class period
		to be able to finish
        in case of any eventuality.&nbsp; This is an open-book,
        open-notebook activity; bring as much documentation to the lab
        as you desire.&nbsp; You may refer to previously-written programs during
		the practicum.&nbsp; Do NOT ask any other student for anything during the
		exam or your score will be zero.&nbsp; If you have any questions, ask the
		instructor.&nbsp; Your work will be graded during
        class -- Practicum 1 is worth <strong><em>50 points</em></strong>.

<h2>Practicum 2 Topics</h2>

<strong>You should be able to:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>Declare an object from a given class<br /><br /></li>
    <li>Instantiate a previously-declared object using the constructor method for the given class<br /><br /></li>
    <li>Call a method for an object<br /><br /></li>
    <li>Declare an array of objects from a given class<br /><br /></li>
    <li>Instantiate a previously-declared array of objects so that it has a specific number of elements<br /><br /></li>
    <li>Use a loop to instantiate each element in the array of objects using the constructor method for the given class<br /><br /></li>
	<li>Write a series of separate instantiation statements for separate elements in the array using the constructor method for the given class<br /><br /></li>
    <li>Write a method that uses a loop to perform the same processing for every element in the array of objects<br /><br /></li>
    <li>Write a method that uses a loop to test each element in the array of objects and perform some processing for those elements in the array that pass the test (in other words, those elements for which the test evaluates as true)<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
