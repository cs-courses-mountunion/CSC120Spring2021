<h2>Practicum 1 Description</h2>

<blockquote>A practicum is an in-lab, on-computer, timed test.&nbsp; The
        activities are designed to be completed in 45 minutes or less, thus allowing
        a significant amount of additional time for students during the class period
		to be able to finish
        in case of any eventuality.&nbsp; This is an open-book,
        open-notebook activity; bring as much documentation to the lab
        as you desire.&nbsp; You may refer to previously-written programs during
		the practicum.&nbsp; Do NOT ask any other student for anything during the
		exam or your score will be zero.&nbsp; If you have any questions, ask the
		instructor.&nbsp; Your work will be graded during
        class -- Practicum 1 is worth <strong><em>30 points</em></strong>.
