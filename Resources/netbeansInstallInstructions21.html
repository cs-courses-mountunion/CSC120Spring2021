        For this course you will need access to a computer system
        that will allow you to browse web pages and
        work with Java programs using 
        <strong>Apache Netbeans</strong>.
        When you are on campus you have access to such systems in the 
        CS Lab (057 KHIC), or by connecting to a Computer Science Virtual Desktop via 
        a web browser from any computer connected to the University network.
        <em><strong>If the University is required to return to remote learning, however,
        you will need internet access and a computer that can connect to the University's 
        virtual private network (VPN)</strong></em>,
        since the CS Virtual Desktop is only available off-campus through the VPN.
        See the <a href="#browser">Accessing the CS Virtual Desktop</a> section below
        for details.
        </p>
        <p>
        If your computer is running Windows 10 or MacOS,
        you can avoid the need to connect to the CS Virtual Desktop, 
        and thus also the VPN,
        by installing Apache Netbeans directly on your computer.
        You may find this to be the most convenient way to do course activities,
        even when you are on campus.
        See the 
        <a href="#installation-instructions">Installing Course Software</a>
        section below for details.
        </p>
    </nav>
      <section id="browser">
        <h2>Accessing the CS Virtual Desktop</h2>
        <p> You can access the Computer Science Virtual Desktop remotely by browsing
          to the <a href="https://viewconnect.mountunion.edu/portal/" target="_blank">viewconnect server</a>.
          For additional information, see 
          <a href="https://portal.mountunion.edu/campusoffice/information_technology/Documents/How%20To/VDI/Accessing%20Zero%20Client.pdf" target="_blank"
          >these directions</a> from Mount Union's IT department on the RaiderWeb portal.
          </p>
          <p>
          If you are off campus, you will need to establish a connection with the 
          Mount Union virtual private network (VPN) before you can access the viewconnect server;
          see 
          <a href="https://portal.mountunion.edu/campusoffice/information_technology/Pages/VPN.aspx" target="_blank"
          >these directions</a> (also on the portal)
          for more information.
          You will also need to fill out a form to request access to the VPN if you 
          haven't already used it, 
          and it may take a little time (possibly several days) for access to be granted,
          so if you plan to use this option fill out the form linked to the 
          <a href="https://portal.mountunion.edu/campusoffice/information_technology/Pages/VPN.aspx" target="_blank"
          >directions</a>
          to request access early.
        </p>
        <p>
          VPN access is supported by IT for Windows and Mac computers.
          <!--
		  If instead you have a Chromebook or are using Linux,
          there is a way to connect to the VPN that is not officially supported by IT,
          but you are allowed to try it on your own.
          On a Chromebook you should be able to install an Android app called
          <a href=
          "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.openconnect"
          >OpenConnect</a> 
          (there are several, but you should use the one I have linked here) 
          to connect to the VPN.
          This app is based on the 
          <a href="https://www.infradead.org/openconnect/globalprotect.html">openconnect</a> 
          package, which can be used to connect to our GlobalProtect VPN from Linux.
          </p>
          <p>
          If you need to connect your Chromebook or Linux machine to the VPN,
          get in touch with me for details.

        <h2>Installing Course Software</h2>
        <p> You can set up Apache Netbeans application on
        your own Windows 10 or Mac computer.
        Start by opening this current instruction page in a browser on the computer you want to install the software on.
        </p>

          If you have an older version of Netbeans already installed,
          it is recommended that you uninstall it before you follow 
          the directions below to install Netbeans 12.2;
          there are different details depending on whether 
          your computer is

            <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/" target="_blank"
            >AdoptOpenJDK</a>.
            Start the installation process by double-clicking the downloaded msi file.
            Press <strong>Next</strong>, accept the license and press  <strong>Next</strong> again, 
            which should bring you to the screen below; 
            at this point select also the <strong>Set JAVA_HOME variable</strong> feature, 
            in addition to the other two features already selected,
            then press <strong>Next</strong> then <strong>Install</strong> then 
            <strong>Yes</strong> and finally <strong>Finish</strong>.

            <p>
            If you see the following dialog box pop up, 
            you didn't select the <strong>Set JAVA_HOME variable</strong> feature correctly
            when you installed OpenJDK11,
            so you will have to run the OpenJDK11 installer again 
            (it's probably in the Downloads folder) 
            and change the features selected so that the 
            <strong>Set JAVA_HOME variable</strong> feature is correctly selected,
            then run the Apache Netbeans install program again.
