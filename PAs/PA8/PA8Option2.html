<font size="+1">Note: You should <b>not</b> work on this assignment during class-time unless:</font>

<ol type="a">
  <li><font size="+1">You have completed all of the in-class assigned work for the day, and</font></li>
  <li><font size="+1">You have permission from the instructor.</font></li>
</ol>

<h4> This assignment must be handed in to your instructor's handin
folder <b>before</b> the beginning of class on the due date.</h4>

<h3>Description:</h3>

<blockquote>
Your program should accept input that represents statistics for some number of baseball players, convert this
input into an array of <b>BaseballPlayer</b> objects, and display specific results obtained by processing the 
array.
</blockquote>

<h3>Input format:</h3>
<blockquote>
    Each line of the input will consist of six values that will be separated by a # character.&nbsp; The
	six values in order from left to right are:
	<blockquote>
	    Player Name &nbsp; (a <code>String</code>) <br/>
	    Home Runs &nbsp; (an <code>Integer</code>) <br/>
	    Batting Average &nbsp; (a <code>Double</code>) <br/>
	    Base Hits &nbsp; (an <code>Integer</code>) <br/>
	    Runs Batted In &nbsp; (an <code>Integer</code>) <br/>
	    Stolen Bases &nbsp; (an <code>Integer</code>) <br/>
	</blockquote>
	Here is an example:
<pre>
Aaron, Hank # 755 # .305 # 3771 # 2297 # 240
</pre>	
    Note that you should use the <code>trim</code> method of the <code>String</code> class to remove
	all leading and trailing spaces from the parts of the input line that you split using "#" as the
	delimiter before processing the values in your program.
</blockquote>

<h3>Array of Objects:</h3>
<blockquote>
    You will need to define a class in your NetBeans project to represent Baseball Players.&nbsp; The class
	definition should have a private data member for each of the values shown above, a constructor method
	that accepts as many parameters as the class has private data members, a "getter" method for each
	private data member, and a toString method. <br/><br/>
	
	The input data should be stored in an array of Baseball Player objects.&nbsp; See Lab # 12 for an example
	of how to do this.
</blockquote>

<h3>Results of Processing to Display</h3>
<blockquote>
    The following should be displayed in the output text area, separated by several blank lines for 
	readability:
	<ol type="a">
	    <li> all of the data in the input, on separate lines (display the result of the toString method, so 
		     that all data are shown in the output area) </li>
        <li> all players who have hit 520 home runs or more </li>
        <li> all players who have a batting average of .310 or higher </li>
		<li> the single player with the most RBIs of any player in the input </li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

<h3>Input Samples to Use:</h3>
<blockquote>
    Your program should be able to process both of these inputs correctly:
	<ol type="i">
	    <li> <a href="baseballStats1.txt"> Top 60 Home Run Hitters of all time</a> </li>
	    <li> <a href="baseballStats2.txt"> Top 12 Batters of all time</a> </li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>
