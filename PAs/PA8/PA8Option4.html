<h4> This assignment must be handed in to your instructor's handin
folder <b>before</b> the beginning of class on the due date.</h4>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<blockquote>
Your program should accept input that represents an image encoded using the PPM format,
convert this
input into numeric values, and use an <b>MUPanel</b> to display the image on the computer screen.
</blockquote>

<h3>Change in User Interface for this Option</h3>
<blockquote>
If you choose this option for PA8, your program does not need an output TextArea -- instead, you should 
have an output drawingPanel that contains an MUPanel object, so that the image may be drawn on the
screen. <br/><br/>

The following .zip file archive contains three files (<b>MUFrame.java</b>, <b>MUFrame.form</b> and 
<b>MUPanel.java</b>) that implement a version of the user interface that you need for this option of PA8.&nbsp;
Feel free to Extract All files from this .zip file and copy the results into the src folder of your PA8
project:
    <blockquote>
	    <a href="PA8_Starter.zip"> PA8_Starter.zip</a>
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>Input format:</h3>
<blockquote>
    The PPM image format encodes an image in a pixel-by-pixel manner.&nbsp; The first three lines of the file
    are the heading of the file, and have the following format:
	<blockquote>
	    P3 <br/>
		&lt;widthInPixels&gt; &lt;heightInPixels&gt; <br/>
	    &lt;maximumColorValue&gt; <br/>
	</blockquote>
	After the heading lines, the file contains &lt;widthInPixels&gt; * &lt;heightInPixels&gt; * 3 numeric 
	values in the range from 0 to &lt;maximumColorValue&gt;, inclusive.&nbsp; Each triplet of numbers
	represents the red, green and blue components of one pixel, in that order.&nbsp; Pixels are specified in
	the file from top to bottom, left to right in the file (called column-major order).&nbsp; When more than
	one value is given on a line, the values are separated by a space. <br/><br/>
	
	Here is an example that defines a 4x4 image that has color values in the range from 0 to 100:
<pre>
P3
4 4
100
0 0 0
0 0 0
10 20 80
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
10 20 80
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
10 60 80
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
10 60 80
0 0 0
</pre>	
    There are 4x4x3 == 48 values afer the first 3 lines that represent the 16 pixels of the image.&nbsp;
	The first four pixel lines represent the left-most column of pixels in the image.<br/><br/>
	
    Note that you should use the <code>trim</code> method of the <code>String</code> class to remove
	all leading and trailing spaces from all parts of the input before processing the values in your program.
</blockquote>

<h3>Outline of Processing Logic:</h3>
<blockquote>
    When the processing button is clicked by the user, the program should split the input entered by the user
	in the input area into separate strings for each line of the input.&nbsp; Next, process the first three
	lines of input separately to obtain the width, height and maxColorValue values from the input.&nbsp;
	Then for each line of image data in the input,
	<ol type="a">
		<li> split the line into three values using the string <code>" "</code> as the delimiter (there is <b>one</b> space between the quotes)</li>
		<li> trim off leading and trailing spaces from each of the three values obtained in the previous step </li>
		<li> convert the three values from the input line into Integers representing the colors of the pixel </li>
		<li> draw the corresponding pixel in the MUPanel using the color information from the input </li>
		<li> that's the end of the for loop </li>	
	</ol>
	Be sure to call <code>muPanel.repaint();</code> at the end of your actionPerformed method in <b>MUFrame</b>
</blockquote>

<h3>Input Samples to Use:</h3>
<blockquote>
    Your program should be able to process all of these inputs correctly:
	<ol type="i">
	    <li> <a href="img_horizstripes.txt"> A horizontally-striped pattern</a> &nbsp; (50 &times; 50) </li>
	    <li> <a href="img_blackbuck.txt"> A picture of an antelope</a> &nbsp; (102 &times; 102) </li>
	    <li> <a href="img_marbles.txt"> A picture of marbles</a> &nbsp; (150 &times; 150) </li>
	    <li> <a href="img_cindricincollege.txt"> Prof. Cindric's college senior photo</a> &nbsp; (100 &times; 100) </li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>
