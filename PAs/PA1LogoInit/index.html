<h2>CSC 120 Programming Assignment 1</h2>
</center>
</font>
<h4> Note:&nbsp;You should <b>not</b> work on this assignment during
                lecture or lab class-time unless:
    <ol type="a">
        <li>You have completed all of the in-class assigned work for the day,
            and</li>
        <li>You have permission from the instructor.</li>
    </ol>
</h4>

<h3> Overview: </h3>
    <blockquote>
    	Develop a Java Application program that draws a visual scene in the 
		graphical output window. &nbsp;Your application must declare, instantiate
		and draw at least TWO (2) objects from each of TWO (2) different classes
		that represent visual objects (in other words, the classes must have a
		<code>draw</code> method that can be called from the <code>MUPanel</code>
		class).&nbsp; One of the classes will use the drawing methods of the Graphics
		class to display a Logo that you develop, and the other class will draw
		your initials made up of the shapes that can be drawn using the Graphics 
		class methods.&nbsp; Each Logo object and each Initials object must be
		drawn in a different screen location.&nbsp;  Details of this assignment
		and links to several example output screens appear below.
		<br><br>
		In effect, this assignment is quite similar to the Boat lab that we've worked on 
		recently; with the requirement that two different-looking classes are written
		by the student, and at least two objects from each of the classes is drawn in 
		different locations on the screen.
    </blockquote>

<h3> Instructions and Requirements: </h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create an application called <span style="font-weight: bold;">PA1
       </span>(no spaces in the name, so <span style="font-weight: bold;">PA1</span>,
	   not <span style="font-weight: bold;">PA 1</span>).&nbsp; It should
	   have the classes <code>MUPanel</code>, <code>Initials</code> and <code>Logo</code>
	   in the files <b>MUPanel.java</b>, <b>Initials.java</b> and <b>Logo.java</b>,
	   respectively.&nbsp; To get started, you can use the <b>MUPanel.java</b> file
	   from previous labs you've worked on in Java (Lab1, for example), and you can
	   right-click on the following links and save the file in the <b>src</b> folder
	   of your <b>PA1</b> project: <br/>
       <ul>
	       <li> <a href="Logo.java"> Logo.java</a> </li><br/>
	   </ul>
	   Then you can copy the Logo.java file and rename the copy as Initials.java, so
	   you have three .java files in the src folder for your project.&nbsp; You can 
	   change the class names <code>Initials</code> and 
	   <code>Logo</code> to names that are more meaningful for your project if you wish.
	</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>In the <code>MUPanel </code>class, there should be two private data members (aka 
	   properties) of type <code>Initials </code>and two private data members of type
	   <code>Logo</code>.&nbsp; They should be instantiated inside of the 
	   <code>MUPanel </code>constructor, and in the <code>paintComponent</code>method
	   each of these objects should be "asked" to draw themselves, by calling their
	   <code>draw </code>method.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>The <code>Initials </code>class and the <code>Logo </code>class each should have
	   data members of type <code>Integer </code> called <code>anchorX</code> and 
	   <code>anchorY</code>.&nbsp; They may have other data members, too, as seen in 
	   the sample Logo.java file you copied earlier.&nbsp; If you aren't going to use
	   some of the data members in the given code, you should delete them from the file
	   to keep your program as simple as possible.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>The <code>Initials </code>class and the <code>Logo </code>class each need a 
	   constructor method to initialize all data members.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>The <code>Initials </code>class and the <code>Logo </code>class each need a
	   <code>draw </code>method that accepts a parameter of type <code>Graphics</code>.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>All drawing done by the <code>draw </code>method of the <code>Initials</code> class
	   should be relative to one fixed point referenced by the <code>anchorX </code>and 
	   <code>anchorY</code> data members. For instance you might use something like <br>
	   </p>
    <pre style="margin-left: 40px;">g.drawRect(anchorX + 25, anchorY + 50, width, height);</pre>
    <p> rather than something like</p>
    <pre style="margin-left: 40px;">g.drawRect(125, 250, width, height);</pre>
    <p>Similarly, the <code>draw </code>method of the <code>Logo</code> class should also
	   draw everything relative to one fixed point referenced by the <code>anchorX </code>
	   and <code>anchorY </code>data members.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>The <code>draw </code>method of the <code>Initials</code> class must use various
	   drawing methods of the <code>Graphics </code>class to draw the three initials of
	   your name in some decorative style without using <code>drawString</code>.&nbsp; You
	   may use your initials or your first name.&nbsp; (If you use your first name, the class
	   should be called <code>FirstName </code>instead of <code>Initials</code>.)<br>
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>The <code>draw </code>method of the <code>Logo</code> class draws some kind of personal logo or
	   some kind of scene relating to a favorite hobby, sport or interest of yours.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>You must use at least four different drawing colors, and at least four different drawing
	   methods of the <code>Graphics </code>class (not counting <code>setColor</code>).&nbsp; For
	   example <code>drawRect</code>, <code>fillRect</code>, <code>drawOval</code>,
	   <code>fillOval</code>, <code>drawArc</code>, and/or <code>fillArc</code>.</p>
	<p>Note:&nbsp; You CANNOT use <code>g.drawString</code> to cause your intitals to be printed on the
	   screen in the <code>Initials</code> class &mdash; you must create the initials from basic shapes 
	   like rectangles, ovals and arcs.&nbsp; However, you can use <code>g.drawString</code>
	   to draw some text in the <code>Logo</code> class.&nbsp; See the last example below (the BOE
	   example), where
	   <code>g.drawString</code> was used to print the name of the soft drink on each of the
	   bottles.
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>DO NOT use any of the shape-drawing or shape-filling methods of the <code>Graphics</code> class
	   in the <code>paintComponent</code> method of the MUPanel class.&nbsp; All drawing must be
	   done in the <code>draw</code> methods of the Logo class and the Initials class.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3> Enhancements: </h3>
<blockquote>
    This assignment includes the requirement to add at least two extra visual features over and above
	the base requirements that make the output of the program more fun,
    interesting, or surprising.&nbsp; Use your creativity and have fun with your 
	drawings!&nbsp; Here are some suggestions for things you could do as enhancements:
    <ol type="a">
	  <li> One possible enhancement would be to define your own colors (in addition to the
		standard ones that are part of the <code>Color</code> class). To do this, you can
		use the following method call:
        <blockquote>
		    <code> g.setColor( new Color( <font color="#990000"><em>red</em></font>,
			                              <font color="#009900"><em>green</em></font>,
										  <font color="#000099"><em>blue</em></font>) ); </code>
        </blockquote>
		where the three parameters shown above represent the intensities of the red, green,
		and blue components of your chosen color, respectively. Each parameter must be an integer
		number between 0 and 255.&nbsp; How do you know the three primary color components 
		of some shade you want to use (such as turquoise)? Visit the 
		<a href="http://html-color-codes.com/rgb.html" target="_blank">VisiBone Color Code Page</a>
		to choose a color (the numbers shown diagaonally in each box give the red, green and blue values
		you should use when creating a new Color, in order from top-left to bottom-right).&nbsp; As 
		an example, to draw using a light shade of yellow, use the following Java method call: <code>
		g.setColor(&nbsp;new&nbsp;Color(&nbsp;255,&nbsp;255,&nbsp;153&nbsp;)&nbsp;);
        </code>
	  </li><br/>
		
	  <li>You could define an additional class or two to be other logo(s) that are displayed on
	    screen along with your <code>Logo</code> and <code>Initials</code> objects as an enhancement.
      </li><br/>
      <li>Another possible enhancement could be using an irregular polygon (see the 
	    <a href="PolygonDemo/PolygonDemo.html">Polygon Demo page</a>).</li>
    </ol>
    You must document your enhancements by adding comment lines at the top of your program in 
	<b>MUPanel.java</b> after your CSC 120, name, etc, comments.&nbsp; Your comments should
	explain what you did for your enhancements.

 </blockquote>
 
 <h3> Turning in your Program for Grading: </h3>
<blockquote>
  When you have completed your NetBeans project for PA1 (including the comment header at
  the top of the MUPanel.java file with your name, etc.), use File Explorer to make a
  .zip file of the <b>PA1</b> folder in your
<b>H:\CSC120\Java</b> folder so that the file is named <b>PA1.zip</b>.&nbsp; Then upload
that file to the PA1 dropbox in <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu" target="_blank">D2L</a>.
