<h4> This assignment must be submitted to the PA6 D2L dropbox <b>before</b> the beginning of class on the due date.</h4>


<h3>Overview:</h3>

<blockquote>Write a Java Application program that declares, instantiates and uses an array of 
objects. In addition to the <b>MUFrame.java</b> and <b>MUPanel.java</b> files, your program 
must include at least two additional class definitions:
<ul>
    <li> a &ldquo;hero&rdquo; class that will be used to set up a visual object that can be moved around
	     the screen with button clicks, and </li>
    <li> an &ldquo;obstacle&rdquo; class that will be used to set up an array of visual objects that the
    	 &ldquo;hero&rdquo; object will attempt to avoid or capture. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Create an application called <b>PA6.</b> It should contain two classes named <b>MUFrame</b> and 
	<b>MUPanel</b>.&nbsp; Start with the three files in the MUFrame&nbsp;with&nbsp;GUI&nbsp;designer
	.zip file available on the Student Resources page of the course web site.<br /><br />
    </li>

    <li>The &ldquo;obstacle&rdquo;  class should have a constructor that determines the position of the object 
	    randomly, or with a formula.&nbsp; That way, the obstacle objects in the array can be instantiated
		with a loop, instead of individually.&nbsp; For example, if you want to have 100 obstacles
		in your program, you can write a loop that is three lines long and is executed 100 
		times, instead of writing 100 separate instantiation statements.<br /><br />
    </li>

    <li>The program must have buttons that will be used to move the &ldquo;hero&rdquo; object around the
	    graphical output window.&nbsp; Use the designer to position the buttons outside the
		drawing panel of your application. <br /><br />
    </li>
  
    <li>Instantiate one &ldquo;hero&rdquo; object and an array of &ldquo;obstacle&rdquo; objects in the constructor
	    method of the <b>MUPanel.java</b> file.<br /><br />
    </li>

    <li>There must be a goal that the user is attempting to attain.&nbsp; The goal can either 
	    be an area of the screen that the &ldquo;hero&rdquo; is attempting to reach while avoiding the
		obstacles, one special obstacle that the &ldquo;hero&rdquo; will try to "capture" while avoiding
		all the OTHER obstacles, or somehow avoiding or capturing all the obstacles before 
		something happens (the obstacles reach a certain point on the screen, a maximum number
		of button clicks has occurred, or a timer runs out).&nbsp; See the examples below for 
		some ideas -- let your imagination guide you, and have fun!<br /><br />
    </li>

    <li>The program must be able to detect when the &ldquo;hero&rdquo; has reached the goal, and display a 
	    message on screen when the goal is reached -- something like "You win!" <br /><br />
    </li>
  
    <li>When a button is clicked, the &ldquo;hero&rdquo; must move on screen appropriately.&nbsp; Also, when
	    any button is clicked, ALL of the obstacles must move somehow (either all the same 
		way, or a randomly determined amount or direction).&nbsp; Once again, see the examples
		to understand this feature.<br /><br />
    </li>

    <li><b>IMPORTANT:</b>&nbsp;  The &ldquo;hero&rdquo; class must include a method that is capable of detecting
	    when the &ldquo;hero&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;s bounding box or drawing area has overlapped (or in other words, is touching)
		an obstacle.&nbsp; This method should accept one parameter, which is an &ldquo;obstacle&rdquo; object,
		and returns a Boolean value.&nbsp; If any part of the bounding rectangle for the obstacle 
		object is within the bounding rectangle of the &ldquo;hero&rdquo; object, return <b>true</b>; else, 
		return <b>false</b>.&nbsp; This method will be called from the 
		<b>MUPanel.java</b> file when the button is clicked -- after the &ldquo;hero&rdquo; and all obstacles
		have been moved, write a loop that will test each element in the array of obstacles to see 
		if that obstacle has collided with the &ldquo;hero&rdquo;. <br /><br />
    </li>
    
    <li>Don't forget your comment header for MUPanel, and put a comment header in each of the
        &ldquo;hero&rdquo; and &ldquo;obstacle&rdquo; class files.<br /><br />
    </li>

    <li>As usual, make a .zip file from the entire PA6 folder from your H:\CSC120\Java space
        and submit it to the PA6 Dropbox in <a href="http://d2l.mountunion.edu" target="_blank"> D2L</a> before the
		due date.<br /><br />
    </li>
</ol>
    
<h3>Note: It is expected that each student will complete this assignment INDIVIDUALLY.</h3>

<h3>Examples (some of these include enhancements
			    over and above the basic requirements): </h3>
				<ul> 
				    <li> <a href="PA6DemoVideo01.mp4" target="_blank"> 
					         Basic example with no enhancements</a> &mdash; move the hero to the right edge of 
							 the window </li>
				    <li> <a href="PA6DemoVideo02.mp4" target="_blank"> 
					         Crude Space Invaders</a> &mdash; touch all the monsters before any of them are
							 able to move below you!</li>
				    <li> <a href="PA6DemoVideo03.mp4" target="_blank"> 
					         MU Frogger</a> &mdash; Can you jump across the highway and avoid being squished
                   by the cars?!?</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
<h3>Ideas for Enhancement of the Basic Requirements:</h3>
<blockquote>
Use your creativity to enhance the basic requirements shown above.&nbsp;  You don't have to do this, but it might make your work
more interesting for you.&nbsp; Here are some suggestions
    for enhancing your project (you are not limited to this list - try things out!):
    <ul>
        <li> Draw interesting shapes for your hero and/or obstacles on screen.<br><br>

        <li> Use Images for the hero and/or obstacles, or have an image as the background of the screen.<br><br>

        <li> Use animation (as seen in the optional part of Lab 8) to make things move or otherwise change on screen between button clicks.<br><br>

        <li> Implement some actual game that you have played and like.<br><br>

    </ul>

    There are many more fun things you could include in this project.&nbsp; Enjoy!
