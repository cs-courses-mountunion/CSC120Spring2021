<h2>CSC 120 Final Exam Review</h2>
</center>
</font>
<h3>For many if not all courses at the University of Mount Union, course learning objectives are listed
on the syllabus for the course.&nbsp; In a technical subject such as CSC 120, many of the learning objectives
use terms and jargon that students may not know (probably don't know?) prior to taking the course.&nbsp; 
But at the end of a course, the objectives can often be used to reflect back upon the activities and topics
that made up the content of the course.&nbsp; For example, here are the learning objectives for CSC 120 as 
shown on the course syllabus: <br/><br/>

<em> Upon completion of this course, the student should be able to: </em>
<ul>
	<!--li>explain how software components interact to execute Java programs
	    and manage data</li-->

	<li>create, compile, and execute Java programs</li>

	<li>declare, instantiate and  use objects that come from one or more class definitions
	    </li>

	<li>declare and use constants and variables represented as one of the
	    Java primitive data types</li>

	<li>write a syntactically-correct Java method signature, when given the number
	    and types of parameters and the return type</li>

	<li>write a complete, syntactically-correct Java method to solve a specific problem</li>

	<li>write a syntactically-correct Java method invocation, when given the signature of the method</li>

	<li>write a complete, syntactically-correct Java class to model graphical or non-graphical entities</li>

	<li>write syntactically- and semantically-correct Java statements to compute the total,
	    average, minimum and maximum value of a series or collection of numerical values</li>

	<li>given the source code for a Java program which manipulates objects from one or more of:
	    the Graphics class, GUI component classes, Strings, one- or two-dimensional arrays,
	    and/or user-defined classes (graphical or non-graphical), and then outputs values
		before, during and after manipulation, <b>write the output</b> of the program on paper</li>

	<li>given a programming problem whose solution requires using objects from one or more
        of: the Graphics class, GUI component classes, Strings, one- or two-dimensional arrays,
        and/or user-defined classes (graphical or non-graphical), <b>write an algorithm</b>
        to solve the problem</li>

	<li>given an algorithm which uses objects from one or more of:
	    the Graphics class, GUI component classes, Strings, one- or two-dimensional arrays,
	    and/or user-defined classes (graphical or non-graphical), <b>translate the algorithm</b>
	    into syntactically- and semantically-correct Java source code</li>
</ul>

Hopefully you can see how these objectives reflect the main content of the course this semester.
