
Methods in a Class Definition
=============================

   Two styles of methods:

      (1)  command-style methods -- used to ask an object to do something without expecting
                                    an answer to be returned

                  ex.  g.fillRect(12, 23, 34, 45);

                       myBoat.draw(g);


              called void methods  --  there is no data being returned as the answer from
                                       the method, so the data type of the answer is void

              called from the main program on a separate line


      (2)   question-style methods -- used to ask an object to return an answer

                  ex.  answer = Math.sqrt(100.0);

                       System.out.println( myYacht.toString() );

              called type-returning methods  --  the method will return an answer to us that
                                                 is a specific data type

              called from the main program as part of a larger statement

              must include a return statement to send answer back to caller


Common methods in Class Definitions
===================================

    toString -- purpose is to return a single text String showing all (or some) property values

    "getter" methods -- purpose is to retrieve (get) the value of a property of an object

    "setter" methods -- purpose is to store a new value (set) in a property of an object



Data Types for Object Properties
================================

    Integer -- positive or negative whole number, or zero

       (3 other types for non-decimal numbers:  Byte, Short, Long)

    Double -- number with a digits to the left and right of 
              the decimal point

       ( 1 other type for decimal numbers:  Float)

    String -- text data

    Boolean -- true or false value

    Color, Font, Graphics -- classes that come with Java
            in the Java Class Hierarchy

    Balloon, Flag, SmileySun, Boat -- classes that we write
