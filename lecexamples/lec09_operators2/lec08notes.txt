
Data Types for Object Properties
================================

    Integer -- positive or negative whole number, or zero

       (3 other types for non-decimal numbers:  Byte, Short, Long)

    Double -- number with a digits to the left and right of 
              the decimal point

       ( 1 other type for decimal numbers:  Float)

    String -- text data

    Boolean -- true or false value

    Color, Font, Graphics -- classes that come with Java
            in the Java Class Hierarchy

    Balloon, Flag, SmileySun, Boat -- classes that we write



Operators
=========

   Symbols that have meaning in a Java program

   data type of the result of the operation depends upon the data
          type(s) of the values being operated upon (the operands)

   Integer operators (both operands are Integers; result is an Integer)
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

      +  :  addition

      -  :  subtraction

      *  :  multiplication

      /  :  integer division

      %  :  remainder


   Double operators (one or both operands are Doubles; result is a Double)
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

      +  :  addition

      -  :  subtraction

      *  :  multiplication

      /  :  real division (gives a decimal part to the answer)


   String operator (one or both operands are Strings; result is a String)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      +  :  concatenation (making a new text string out of two pieces)

           ex.  "Hello" + "Goodbye"   --->    "HelloGoodbye"

                "The answer is " + 15.7    --->    "The answer is 15.7"



   Operator Precedence Rules
   =========================
   
           ( )

           *  /  %

           +  -
