
Data Types for Object Properties
================================

    Integer -- positive or negative whole number, or zero

       (3 other types for non-decimal numbers:  Byte, Short, Long)

    Double -- number with a digits to the left and right of 
              the decimal point

       ( 1 other type for decimal numbers:  Float)

    String -- text data

    Boolean -- true or false value

    Color, Font, Graphics -- classes that come with Java
            in the Java Class Hierarchy

    Balloon, Flag, SmileySun, Boat -- classes that we write



Operators
=========

   Symbols that have meaning in a Java program

   data type of the result of the operation depends upon the data
          type(s) of the values being operated upon (the operands)

   Integer operators (both operands are Integers; result is an Integer)
   --------------------------------------------------------------------

      +  :  addition

      -  :  subtraction

      *  :  multiplication

      /  :  integer division

      %  :  remainder


   Double operators (one or both operands are Doubles; result is a Double)
   -------------------------------------------------------------------

      +  :  addition

      -  :  subtraction

      *  :  multiplication

      /  :  real division (gives a decimal part to the answer)


   String operator (one or both operands are Strings; result is a String)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

      +  :  concatenation (making a new text string out of two pieces)

           ex.  "Hello" + "Goodbye"   --->    "HelloGoodbye"

                "The answer is " + 15.7    --->    "The answer is 15.7"



Operator Precedence Rules
=========================
   
      ( )
	  
      *  /  %

      +  - 




Methods in a Class Definition
=============================

   Two styles of methods:

      (1)  command-style methods -- used to ask an object to do something without expecting
                                    an answer to be returned

                  ex.  g.fillRect(12, 23, 34, 45);

                       myBoat.draw(g);


              called void methods  --  there is no data being returned as the answer from
                                       the method, so the data type of the answer is void

              called from the main program on a separate line


      (2)   question-style methods -- used to ask an object to return an answer

                  ex.  answer = Math.sqrt(100.0);

                       System.out.println( myYacht.toString() );

              called type-returning methods  --  the method will return an answer to us that
                                                 is a specific data type

              called from the main program as part of a larger statement

              must include a return statement to send answer back to caller
