    <p>This lab is another example of the use of the <code>split</code> method of the <b>String</b> class, and
	   illustrates how we can process lines of information that contain more than one value per line.</p>

    <ol type="A">

        <li><b>Get the beginning version of the Lab12 program up and running.</b><br /><br />

            <ol>

                <li>Create a new Netbeans project called <b>Lab12</b>.
                    Make sure the Location is in your H:\CSC120\Java folder.<br /><br />
                </li>

                <li>In your web browser, right click on
                    <b><a href="MUFrame.java">MUFrame.java</a></b>
                    and choose <b>Save Target As...</b> (or <b>Save Link As...)</b>
                    and save the file in the <b>src</b> folder of your project.&nbsp; <br /><br />
                </li>

                <li>Compile and run the program at this time.&nbsp; Then
				    type your name and some text on multiple lines in the
                    input area at the top of the window and click the Process Input button to see 
					what happens.&nbsp; The program should show each line of the input you entered with a line number, starting with line 0.<br /><br />
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li><b>Use the <code>split</code> method to break each line of input into separate values.</b><br /><br />

            <ol>

                <li>Now that we have an array that contains each line of the input in a separate array element,
				    we can process each line of input in the body of a <code>for</code> loop.&nbsp; Let's say we
					have some data that describes the makeup of the Cleveland Orchestra for the current season.&nbsp;
					Each line of input will contain three values for a different type of instrument in the
					orchestra:&nbsp; the name of the instrument, the orchestra section to which the instrument
					belongs, and the number of musicians that play that instrument this season.&nbsp; Each of
					these values is separated from each other by a semicolon.&nbsp; 
				    <br/><br/>
					To split each line of input into three pieces, we can use the following code in the
					<code>for</code> loop that displays each line in the output area:
<pre>
    String[] part = lineOfInput[x].split(";");
</pre>					
                    Now we have an array of <code>String</code>s called <code>part</code>, where element 0
					of the array contains the instrument name, element 1 contains the instrument's section
					and element 2 contains the number of musicians for this instrument.

				</li>

                <li>In your web browser, right click on
                    <b><a href="Instrument.java">Instrument.java</a></b>
                    and choose <b>Save Target As...</b> (or <b>Save Link As...)</b>
                    and save the file in the <b>src</b> folder of your project.&nbsp; This file defines the
					<code>Instrument</code> class with private data members for each of the three
					pieces of data described above.&nbsp; Look at the code in this file and make sure
					you understand how it is written. <br /><br />
                </li>

				<li>At the top of the <b>MUFrame</b> class, declare an array of Instrument objects.&nbsp; Then, 
				    immediately before the <code>for</code> loop in the actionPerformed method 
				    for the processInput button, instantiate
					the array of Instruments so that there are as many elements in this array as there are
					lines in the input.
                    <br/><br/>
				</li>
				
				<li>Inside the <code>for</code> loop in the actionPerformed method for the processInput button,
				    do the following:
					<ul>
					    <li> split the input line into an array of Strings called <code>part</code>,
						     using a semicolon as the delimiter (see the code example above) </li>
						<li> <code> for (Integer p = 0; p < part.length; p++) {<br/> &nbsp; &nbsp; part[p] = part[p].trim();<br/>} // end for</code> </li>
						<li> instantiate element <code>x</code> (or whatever you called your for loop control
						     variable) of the array of <code>Instrument</code> objects, using the <code>part</code> array as the values to pass to the constructor method  </li>
							 <ul>
							     <li> the first parameter for the constructor call should be &nbsp;<code>part[0]</code> </li>
							     <li> the second parameter for the constructor call should be &nbsp;<code>part[1]</code> </li>
							     <li> the third parameter for the constructor call should be &nbsp;<code>Integer.parseInt( part[2] )</code> </li>
							 </ul>
						<li> change the <code>append</code> call inside the loop to be this:
<pre>
    outputArea.append( "line " + x + ": " + instrumentArray[index].toString() + "\n" );
</pre>
						 (you may need to change the names of <code>index</code> and <code>instrumentArray</code> in this
						 sample to be the names you used in your program)</li>
					</ul>
				    <br>
				</li>
				
				<li>Run your program, and test it with this data from the Cleveland Orchestra:
					<blockquote>
					<form>
					  <textarea rows="5" cols="50">
Timpani; Percussion; 2
Drum; Percussion; 2
Triangle; Percussion; 1
Wood Blocks; Percussion; 1
French Horn; Brass; 6
Trumpet; Brass; 4
Cornet; Brass; 2
Trombone; Brass; 3
Bass Trombone; Brass; 1
Euphonium; Brass; 1
Tuba; Brass; 1
Violin, 1st; Strings; 18
Violin, 2nd; Strings; 16
Viola; Strings; 11
Cello; Strings; 11
Bass; Strings; 9
Harp; Strings; 2
Flute; Woodwinds; 4
Piccolo; Woodwinds; 1
Oboe; Woodwinds; 4
English Horn; Woodwinds; 1
Clarinet; Woodwinds; 6
Bassoon; Woodwinds; 4
Contra-Bassoon; Woodwinds; 1
Piano; Keyboards; 2
Harpsichord; Keyboards; 1
</textarea>
					</form>
					</blockquote>
				The program should print information for 26 different instruments from this test data.
                    <br/><br/>				
                </li>
				
				<li>Add code to your program that prints the following information about the orchestra:<br><br>
				    <ol type="i">
					    <li> after all of the instruments in the orchestra have been printed, print a single line
                             that shows the total number of musicians in the entire orchestra </li>
					    <li> next, print a line for every instrument in the orchestra that is in the "Brass" section </li>
					    <li> then, print only one line that shows the total number of musicians in the Strings section </li>
					    <li> finally, print only one line that shows the maximum number of musicians that play any 
						     instrument in the Woodwinds section </li>
					</ol> <br>
					    For the test data given for this lab, your program should print that there are 115 musicians in the
						entire orchestra, 67 of whom play in the Strings section.&nbsp; There are 7 different instruments in the
						Brass section (French Horn, Trumpet, Cornet, Trombone, Bass Trombone, Euphonium and Tuba), and the 
						maximum number of musicians for any instrument in the Woodwinds section is 6.
