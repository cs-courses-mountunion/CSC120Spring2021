		  the speed of the fastest car in the each of the two arrays.<br/><br/>

      <li><b><font face="Arial">Examine at the <code>Car</code> and the <code>MUFrame</code> class definitions.</font></b><br />

          <li>You do not need to change
      the <code><span style="font-weight: bold;">Car</span> </code>class
      definition at all, but take a look at it now in the Netbeans editor window so you can see the
      methods that "get" the <code>Car </code>data members.&nbsp; You will need to call these
      "getter" methods to complete this lab activity. <br/><br/>
          </li>
          <li>Now take a look at the <code><b>MUFrame</b></code> class definition in the Netbeans
		  editor.&nbsp; Notice that this program declares two different arrays of Car objects, and
		  instantiates them with a different number of elements.&nbsp; Then each position in both arrays
		  is instantiated with specific values. <br/><br/>
		  The program then calls a method twice to display the speed of the fastest car in each array, and then skips a blank line.&nbsp; Then
		  the program calls a different method twice to return the speed of the fastest car in each array, and skips a blank line.&nbsp; The
		  methods themselves follow &ndash; you can use these as examples when solving the problems given in this lab.

          </li>

      </li>
      <li><b><font face="Arial">Create and Test a <code>displayAllCars</code> Method.</font></b><br />
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>In <code>MUFrame</code>, write a simple version of the
          method, that just does a <code>System.out.println() </code>of
          the name of the method.&nbsp; It should look like this:
<pre>
public void displayAllCars( Car[] theArray ) {

    System.out.println("running the displayAllCars method...");

} // end of displayAllCars()
</pre>
		  </li>
          <li>Next, scroll to the constructor
          method of <code>MUFrame</code> and call your new method.&nbsp; In
          this case the line of code to do this in the constructor method would
          be either <b><code>displayAllCars( domestic );</code></b> or 
		  <b><code>displayAllCars( imported );</code></b><br/><br/>
		  After doing this, call <b><code>displayABlankLine();</code></b> so that
		  the output of the this method call will be visually separated from
		  the rest of the output in the Java Console. <br/><br/>
          </li>
          <li>Then run the program and make sure it executes and displays
          the method name in the Java Console correctly. <br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>In <code>MUFrame</code>, replace the <code>System.out.println</code> statement
		   in the body of the <code>displayAllCars</code> method with code that uses a <code>for</code> loop to
		   perform the required computations that will display the desired output in the Java Console.&nbsp;
		   Hint:&nbsp; the <code>Car</code> class has a <code>toString()</code> method defined that you
		   should use to obtain the correct output for this method.<br />
        <br />
          </li>
          <li>Finally, call this method in the <b>MUFrame</b> constructor twice, once for each array 
		  of <code>Car</code> objects, and be sure to display a blank line between the two listings.<br />
            <br />
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
	  
      <li><b><font face="Arial">Create and Test Several Additional Methods that will process an 
	         array of <code>Car</code> objects.</font></b><br />
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>You will work on this part of the lab activity in stages ... one method definition
      and method call combination at a time.&nbsp; Use the sequence described in the previous instruction set
	  for the <code>displayAllCars</code> method for each of the following methods.
		  <br />
            <br />
			There are two styles of methods for you to write in this lab activity.&nbsp; Methods whose name starts with
			"display" are supposed to use <code>System.out.println</code> statements to display their results
			directly and immediately in the Java Console.&nbsp; Methods whose name starts with "return" should NOT
			include any <code>System.out.println</code> statements, but should return their computed answer to 
			the calling point via the use of a <code>return</code> statement.&nbsp; When a "return"-style method is 
			called from the <code>MUFrame</code> constructor, it must be called from within a <code>System.out.println</code> statement.
			<br/><br/>
      Each of these
      methods requires that an array of <code>Car</code> objects be passed into the
      method as a parameter. You can write the methods in any order you
      like, but get one working before starting on another. Although you
      may not have time to finish all of the methods listed here, complete as
      many as you can in the schedule lab time today, and finish the rest whenever you can. <br/><br/>
          </li>
          <li>Write and call a method named <code><b>displayAverageMPGFor</b></code> which will 
		  display the average mpg for all objects in
        the array in the Java
        Console, in a format like this: "The average mpg of all Car objects is
        25.875". &nbsp; 
        Your answer should have a decimal point. If your answer is
        something like 25 or 25.0, you need to do something to not
        lose the fractional part of the average. <br/><br/>
          </li>
          <li>Write and call a method named <code><b>returnWorstMPGFor</b></code> which will return the worst (i.e., lowest) 
		  miles per gallon (mpg) for any Car object in the array. <br />
            <br />
          </li>
          <li>Write and call a method named <code><b>displayAboveAvgMPG</b> </code>that calculates and prints
        the average MPG of all cars in the array in the Java Console, and then on the next several lines, 
        displays the results of the <code>toString()</code> method for all objects in the array whose MPG
        is above average.  Each above average MPG car should be displayed on a separate line in the Java Console.&nbsp;
        Note that your method must use two separate loops to perform this task.
        <br /><br />
		Call this method in <b>MUFrame</b> twice, once for each array of Car objects, and be
		sure to display a blank line after each of the two listings.<br />
        <br />
          </li>
          <li>What if regulations concerning the way to calculate miles
        per gallon, mpg, were changed and for every <code>Car</code> object, the mpg
        value is to be reduced by 2 mpg.&nbsp; Write and call a method to
        accomplish this task.&nbsp; In order to see the
        results for this in the Java Console, call <code><b>displayAllCars</b></code>
        before and after making the changes with this method.<br />
        <br />
          </li>
          <li>We want to know the number of red cars in the array.&nbsp; Either we could write
        and call a method that would count them and display a message in
        the Java Console such as "There are 3 red cars." or we could
        write a method that counts and returns the number of red cars
        and use that method in a System.out.println in the <code>MUFrame</code>
        constructor method. Do this both ways! Write and call both <b><code>displayNumberOfRedCars</code></b>
        and <b><code>returnNumberOfRedCars.</code></b><br />
        <br />
        Remember that you cannot compare two objects with <code>==</code>,
        so you must use the <code>.equals</code> method of the Color
        class with something like this:
        <pre>      if (theArray[i].getCarColor().equals(Color.RED))</pre>
          </li>
          <li>Write and call a method which finds the name of the car
        with the fastest speed.&nbsp; In this case you need to go through the
        loop and remember the position of the <code>Car</code> object for which the <b>mph</b>
        data member is the highest. You will need two variables inside
        the method, one to remember the highest <em>value</em> of <b>mph</b>
        and the other to remember the corresponding <em>name</em>. Or,
        just use an integer to remember the position/index of the one
        with the highest mph, and after the loop use that index to get
        the name. <br />
        <br />
        Can you do this both ways as <code><b>displayNameOfFastestCar</b></code>
		and as <code><b>returnNameOfFastestCar</b></code>? One displays the answer 
		and the other returns a <code>String</code> with the answer.
